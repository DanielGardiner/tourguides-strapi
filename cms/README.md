# Instructions

- Setup new mysql database
- copy paste `.env.example` into `.env` and update the database values
- run `nvm use`, this will look inside the .nvmrc file and use the appropriate nodejs version
- run `npm i`, this will install dependencies
- run `npm run develop`, this will populate the database with the appropriate schema as defined in `/src` which is automatically generated when admin users create content types within the UI

### CMS customisations

Strapi offers some limited customisations to be made via config changes within `/src/admin/app.js` e.g. changing text and logos. However more granular customisation are currently not possible. We therefore need to patch the relevant files within `node_modulas` if we want to make these granular customisations. This approach is not ideal but is currently the only option, see here for details: https://forum.strapi.io/t/customize-the-dashboard-welcome-page/939/21.

If further customisations are required:
1. Go into the relevant file and makes changes, the relevant files will likely be in `/node_modules/@strapi/admin/admin/src/pages`
1. Then run `npm run generate-admin-patches`, this will generate the relevant patch files in `/patches`

We can then apply these patches, for example if we update strapi or when packages are initially installed packages, by running `npm run apply-admin-patches`.
